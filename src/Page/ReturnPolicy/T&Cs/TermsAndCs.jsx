 <p className='text-[#000] text-sm font-medium'>5 Conclusion of sales and availability of stocke</p>

    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>
<li>5.1 Registered users may place orders for Goods, which Takealot or the Third Party Seller may accept or reject. Whether or not Takealot or the Third Party Seller accepts an order depends on the availability of Goods, correctness of the information relating to the Goods (including without limitation the price) and receipt of payment or payment authorisation by Takealot for the Goods.</li>
<li className='text-[#000] font-medium'>5.2 <span className='underline'>NOTE: Takealot or the Third Party Seller will indicate the acceptance of your order by delivering the Goods to you or allowing you to collect them, and only at that point will an agreement of sale between you and Takealot or the Third Party Seller come into effect (the “Sale”).</span> This is regardless of any communication from Takealot stating that your order or payment has been confirmed. Takealot will indicate the rejection of your order (by Takealot itself or the Third Party Seller) by cancelling it and, as soon as possible thereafter, refunding you for any amount already paid.</li>

<li>5.3 Prior to delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may cancel an order at any time provided you do so before receiving a dispatch or delivery notice. After delivery or your collection of the Goods, you may return the Goods only in accordance with the Returns Policy.</li>

<li>5.4 Any order of a <span className='font-medium'>television</span> will be subject to the condition that we obtain from you your valid TV licence number and your account holder ID. If we do not receive your TV licence number and your account holder ID, or your TV licence number cannot be validated, you will not be able to check out with the television in your shopping basket.</li>

<li className='text-[#000] font-medium'>5.5 Placing Goods in a wishlist or shopping basket without completing the purchase cycle does not constitute an order for such Goods, and as such, Goods may be removed from the shopping basket  if stock is no longer available or the price thereof might change without notice to you. You cannot hold Takealot or the Third Party Seller liable if such Goods are not available or are not available at the particular price when you complete or attempt to complete the purchase cycle at a later stage.</li>

<li className='text-[#000] font-medium'>5.6 You acknowledge that stock of all Goods on offer is limited and that pricing may change at any time without notice to you. In the case of Goods for sale by Takealot, Takealot will take all reasonable efforts to monitor stock levels and ensure that when stock is no longer available, that offers thereof are discontinued on the Website. However, we cannot guarantee the availability of stock. When Goods are no longer available after you have placed an order, Takealot will notify you and you will be entitled to a refund of any amount already paid by you for such Goods. </li>

<li>5.7 <span className='text-[#000] font-medium'>In the case of Goods for sale by a Third Party Seller, Takealot relies on inventory information supplied by the relevant Third Party Seller and Takealot accordingly bears no liability for any inaccuracies in the information supplied to it.</span> Consequently, should you order any Goods from a Third Party Seller which are in fact sold-out, any resulting dispute should be resolved between you and the relevant Third Party Seller, your respective rights and obligations being as set out in these Terms and Conditions.</li>


<li>5.8 Certain Goods may not be purchased for re-sale. Should we suspect that any such Goods are being purchased for sale, we are entitled to cancel your order immediately on notice to you.</li>

    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>9.1 Takealot may from time to time make physical or electronic gift vouchers (“Gift Vouchers”) and promotional coupons or discounts (“Coupons”) available for use on the Website towards the purchase of Takealot Goods. Gift Vouchers and Coupons can only be redeemed while they are valid and their expiry dates cannot be extended. More specifically:</li>

<li><span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>9.2 Gift Vouchers</span>
    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>
<li>9.2.1 Gift Vouchers that are purchased by registered users are valid for 3 years after Sale. Gift Vouchers that Takealot gives away for free are valid for the period stated thereon. In each case, if your Voucher has not been used within that period, it will expire.</li>

<li>9.2.2 Gift Vouchers cannot be used to buy other Gift Vouchers or Coupons. They do not accrue interest and are not refundable for cash once purchased or otherwise obtained. If your Gift Voucher value is less than the amount required to cover the full order you wish to place, you may make up the difference by paying via one of our other payment methods.</li>

<li className='font-medium text-[#000]'>9.2.3 Takealot is not responsible for any harm due to the loss, unauthorised use or unauthorised distribution of a Gift Voucher, after it has delivered the Gift Voucher to you or the email address nominated by you.</li>

</li>

<li><span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>9.3 Coupons</span>
    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>
<li>9.3.1 There are two types of Coupons; a Coupon with a fixed amount of a discount, e.g. R100 off (“Fixed Coupon“), and a Coupon with a percentage discount, e.g. 10% off (“<span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>Percentage Coupon</span>“).</li>

<li>9.3.2 Coupons are issued in Takealot’s sole discretion and we are entitled at any time to correct, cancel or reject a Coupon for any reason (including without limitation where a Coupon has been distributed in an unauthorised manner). Users do not have a right to Coupons, and Coupons cannot be earned. Coupons are issued under specific terms and conditions regulating when and how they may be used.</li>

<li>9.3.3 As a general rule, and unless specified otherwise on the specific Coupon itself:

<ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>
<li>9.3.3.1 each Coupon can only be used once</li>

<li>9.3.3.2 only one Coupon can be used per order;</li>

<li>9.3.3.3 only one Coupon can be used on the Website per person per promotion/campaign;</li>

<li>9.3.3.4 Percentage Coupons may only be redeemed on purchases with a total cart value of less than R5,000;</li>

<li>9.3.3.5 where a Percentage Coupon has been used and you wish to cancel any items in the order prior to making payment, the entire order must be cancelled. You will be issued with a new Percentage Coupon and will need to place the order again, without the item that you wished to cancel;</li>

<li>9.3.3.6 a Coupon must be used at check-out – it cannot be used later on existing orders; and</li>

<li>9.3.3.7 the value of the Coupon will be set off against the value of your shopping basket and the balance remaining, if any, will be payable by you.</li>
    </ul>

<li>9.3.4 Coupons cannot be used to buy Gift Vouchers or other Coupons, and cannot be exchanged or refunded for cash or credit. <span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>Takealot is not responsible for any harm due to the loss, unauthorised use or distribution of a Coupon.</span></li>

<li>9.3.5 If for any reason a Coupon does not reflect on the final amount due from you at check-out, you can contact us here to confirm if the Coupon is still valid.  If Takealot confirms that the Coupon is still valid and you have already placed your order, you can choose whether to cancel the order and place it again with the Coupon, or you can use the Coupon on your next order within the limitations of the specific Coupon’s terms and conditions.</li>

<li>9.3.6 You may be required to submit the original communication containing the Coupon code, and any other information reasonably requested by Takealot, before you are able to use a Coupon.</li>

 <p className='text-[#000] text-sm font-medium'>10 Daily Deals and other discounted Goods</p>

    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>10.1 From time to time, we may offer certain Goods at discounted prices as part of a Daily Deal, App Only Deal, Bundle Deal or any other temporary deal which are explained below (each a “<span className='font-medium'>Deal</span>”). These will be subject to certain conditions (as set out in these Terms and/or the Website), which define the scope of the Deal. If you buy a product within the scope of a Deal, you will pay the discounted price for that product (the “<span className='font-medium'>Deal Price</span>”).</li>

<li>10.2 However, if you buy a product in a manner that falls outside of the scope of a Deal, then you will pay the then current (non-Deal) selling price on the Website (the “<span className='font-medium'>Normal Price</span>”), for each product that falls outside the scope of the Deal.</li>

<li>10.3 For example: if you buy more than one product in a Daily Deal, you will pay the Deal Price for the first product, but the Normal Price for all products thereafter. Alternatively, if you buy a product in combination with any other products that together do not constitute a Bundle Deal, you will pay the Normal Price for all such products falling outside the scope of the relevant Deal.</li>

<li><span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>10.4 Daily Deals</span>
    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>
<li>10.4.1 At our discretion, Daily Deals (“<span className='font-medium'>Deals</span>”) are available daily from 7am – 23:59pm on week days and from 9am – 23:59pm on weekends. In addition, please note that Daily Deals have a stock limit and may expire earlier if stock runs out.</li>

<li>10.4.2 Daily Deals quantities are limited and as such, after a Daily Deal is sold out, those particular Goods may be available on the Website at their normal selling prices (but no longer as a Daily Deal).</li>

<li className='font-medium text-[#000]'>10.4.3 We do not guarantee a specific saving. The extent of the Daily Deal or discount is at the sole discretion of Takealot.</li>

<li>10.4.4 Four of each Daily Deal may be purchased per customer, limited to your first order daily.</li>
<li>10.4.5 Adding a Daily Deal to your cart, or completing your order for a Daily Deal without paying for it, does not reserve the item for you. Takealot must receive payment from you within 24 hours of you placing your order for a Daily Deal, otherwise we will cancel your order.</li>
<li>10.4.6 Takealot will reserve stock for customers in the order in which it receives payment. Therefore if you pay via EFT, you might not get your item because Takealot may only receive payment from you a few days later, and in the meantime the Daily Deal might sell out to customers paying immediately.</li>
<li>10.4.7 The List Price shown in respect of Daily Deals and other discounted Goods is the recommended retail price suggested to us by the supplier of the relevant product. Where the supplier has not provided a recommended retail price, an estimate may be provided. Where a product is offered for sale by a Third Party Seller, the List Price may be provided by the Third Party Seller.</li>
<li className='text-[#000] font-medium'>10.4.8 By purchasing any Daily Deal, you are also automatically opting in for our Daily Deals daily newsletter as well as our general newsletter (you may opt-out of these newsletters at any time). Opting out of these newsletters after purchase will not affect the value of the Goods purchased.</li>
    </ul>

<li><span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>10.5 App Only Deals</span>
    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>10.5.1 We also have Daily Deals (called “<span className='font-medium'>App Only Deals</span>“) which will only be available for purchase using the Takealot software application (“App”), although they may also be displayed on the Takealot website and mobi-site. The App can be downloaded on IOS and Android devices. In addition to the above Daily Deal Terms and Conditions, the following terms apply to App Only Deals:

<ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>
<li>10.5.1.1 App Only Deals are only available for purchase using the App and their prices may differ from the normal selling prices at which those particular Goods may be available on the website or mobi-site.</li>
<li>10.5.1.2 You will only receive the App Only Deal price if you pay for your order using the App before the App Only Deal has expired or sells out. You will not receive the App Only Deal price if you pay for your order using the website or mobi-site, or if you don’t pay for your order before the App Only Deal has expired or sells out.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
</li>

<li><span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>10.6 Bundle Deals</span>
    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>10.6.1 We may from time to time offer bundle deals for sale under the Bundle Deals tab on the Website (“<span className='font-medium'>Bundle Deals</span>“). Each Bundle Deal will consist of two or more products that either we or you (as provided on the Website) have combined together in a single bundle.
</li>

<li>10.6.2 Any saving or discount resulting from purchasing a Bundle Deal instead of its component products separately may be applied to any of the component products individually in our sole discretion. The actual purchase price (after applying any applicable saving or discount) of each component product will be communicated to you upon checkout and reflected in your order history. This is relevant to the amount that would be refunded to you, if you were to return any product in a Bundle Deal for a refund, in accordance with our Returns Policy.
</li>


<li>10.6.3 A Bundle Deal should be distinguished from a pre-packed bundle compiled by our supplier and supplied to us as a single unit (“<span className='font-medium'>Bundle Deals</span>“). Any saving or discount in respect of a Pre-packed Bundle will be applied only to the total bundle price and not to the prices of the individual component products. Please refer to our Returns Policy for information about returning a Pre-packed Bundle.

    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>13.1 An “<span className='font-medium'>Online Course</span>” is a form of distance learning which allows you to develop your skills and knowledge on a certain topic, via the internet. In order to complete an online course, you need to have your own email account and access to the internet. You do not need to attend classes or visit an education campus. On completion, you will typically receive a digital certificate. Some online courses may require you to complete an assessment (also done online) to complete the course. Online Courses are accessible by means of an Online Course Code</li>

<li>13.2 An “<span className='font-medium'>Online Course Code</span>” is a unique digital code that can be redeemed on the respective websites of certain Online Course providers. Upon redeeming the Online Course Code on the website of such Online Course providers, you will either be enrolled for the particular course automatically, or you will be given credit on the Online Course provider’s website which will enable you to enrol for the particular course you have purchased. Your access to any Online Course Code purchased by you from us will be granted via the unique digital code that will be sent to you by email, to the email address we have on file.</li>

</span>
    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>13.4 <span className='font-medium text-[#000]'>Ordering Online Course Codes
</span>: when ordering Online Course Codes from us, you will be ordering the right to access an Online Course from the relevant Online Course provider, on their website. Consequently, if Takealot accepts your order, delivery will take place electronically via the internet as described below:

<li>13.4.1.2 Access to the Online Course may be denied if you have completed the Online Course, or Takealot has removed it pursuant to your having ‘returned’ the Online Course (if possible in accordance with Takealot’s Returns Policy pertaining to Online Course Codes from time to time);</li>

<li>13.4.1.3<span className='font-medium'>Takealot does not guarantee that Online Course providers will make their Online Courses available for download and use indefinitely and Takealot accepts no responsibility or liability to you or any other person if, upon your utilising the Online Course Code, the relevant Online Course is no longer available, provided that, if you discover and report such a problem within 6 months of your receipt of the Online Course Code, you will be entitled to a full refund of the purchase price paid therefor.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>13.4.2 We do not charge any delivery fees for electronic delivery of the relevant Online Course Code, however, you may incur costs (eg internet service provider fees) associated with accessing and using the Online Course, and <span className='font-medium'>we will not under any circumstances be liable for any such costs incurred by you.</span></li>

<ul className='my-2 pl-4 space-y-2'>

 <p className='text-[#000] text-sm font-medium'>14 Third Party Sellers</p>

    <ul className='my-2 pl-8 space-y-2'>

<li>14.1 Takealot will indicate on relevant product pages and checkout pages when Goods are for sale by a Third Party Seller. In such cases Takealot only provides the platform to facilitate transactions between Third Party Sellers and Takealot customers. Takealot is neither the buyer nor the seller of these Goods unless otherwise specified.</li>
<li>14.2 The Sale formed on acceptance of your order (in accordance with clause 5.2) for Goods that are for sale by a Third Party Seller is therefore solely between the registered user and such Third Party Seller. Takealot is not a party to that sale.</li>
<li>14.3 The Third Party Seller is solely responsible for fulfilment of delivery of the Goods. The Third Party Seller is also responsible to provide an invoice to the registered user if required.</li>
<li>14.4 Not all Third Party Sellers are registered VAT (Value-Added Tax) vendors. Only Third Party Sellers who are registered VAT vendors may charge VAT on Goods sold and issue a tax invoice in respect thereof. If a Third Party Seller is not a registered VAT Vendor, it may not charge VAT on Goods sold and will not be in a position to issue a tax invoice in respect thereof.</li>
<li>14.5 Because Takealot wants the registered user to have a safe and consistent experience, Takealot will handle any returns under the CPA or the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 2002 (“<span className='font-medium'>ECT Act</span>”), by the registered user arising out of or in connection with the Sale between a registered user and a Third Party Seller on behalf of the Third Party Seller according to Takealot’s own Returns Policy. Should such claim escalate into being a dispute, although Takealot is entitled to become involved in an attempt to resolve it, Takealot is not obliged to do so and any disputes must be resolved between you and the relevant Third Party Seller alone.</li>

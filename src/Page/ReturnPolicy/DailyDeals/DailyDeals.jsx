 <p className='text-[#000] text-lg font-semibold'>Daily Deals Terms and Conditions</p>

<ul className='pl-8 space-y-2 list-decimal'>
<li>These Daily Deals Terms and Conditions are subject to, and should be read with, our general Terms and Conditions.</li>
<li>At our discretion, Daily Deals (“<span className='font-medium'>Deals</span>”) are available daily from 7am – 23:59pm on week days and from 9am – 23:59pm on weekends. In addition, please note that Daily Deals have a stock limit and may expire earlier if stock runs out.</li>
<li>Deal quantities are limited and as such, after a Deal is sold out, those particular Goods may be available on the Website at their normal selling prices (but no longer as a Deal).</li>
<li>We do not guarantee a specific saving. The extent of the Deal is at the sole discretion of Takealot.</li>
<li>Four of each Daily Deal may be purchased per customer.</li>
<li>Adding a Deal to your cart, or completing your order for a Deal without paying for it, does not reserve the item for you. Takealot must receive payment from you within 24 hours of you placing your order for a Deal, otherwise we will cancel your order.</li>
<li>Takealot will reserve stock for customers in the order in which it receives payment. Therefore if you pay via EFT, you might not get your item because Takealot may only receive payment from you a few days later, and in the meantime the Deal might sell out to customers paying immediately.</li>
<li>The List Price shown in respect of Deals and other discounted Goods is the recommended retail price suggested to us by the supplier of the relevant product. Where the supplier has not provided a recommended retail price, an estimate may be provided. Where a product is offered for sale by a Third Party Seller, the List Price may be provided by the Third Party Seller.</li>
<li className='font-medium'>By purchasing any Deal, you are also automatically opting in for our Daily Deals daily newsletter as well as our general newsletter (you may opt-out of these newsletters at any time). Opting out of these newsletters after purchase will not affect the value of the Goods purchased.</li>
<li>Takealot reserves the right to amend these Terms and Conditions at any time without notice to you.</li>

 <p className='text-[#000] text-lg font-semibold'>App Only Deals Terms and Conditions</p>
 <p>We also have Deals (called “<span className='font-medium'>App Only Deals</span>”) which will only be available for purchase using the Takealot software application (“<span className='font-medium'>App</span>”), although they may also be displayed on the Takealot website and mobi-site. The App can be downloaded on IOS and Android devices. <span className='underline'>In addition to the above Daily Deal Terms and Conditions, the following terms apply to App Only Deals:</span></p>

<ul className='pl-8 space-y-2 list-decimal'>
<li>App Only Deals are only available for purchase using the App and their prices may differ from the normal selling prices at which those particular Goods may be available on the website or mobi-site.</li>

<li>You will only receive the App Only Deal price if you pay for your order using the App before the App Only Deal has expired or sells out. You will not receive the App Only Deal price if you pay for your order using the website or mobi-site, or if you don’t pay for your order before the App Only Deal has expired or sells out.</li>

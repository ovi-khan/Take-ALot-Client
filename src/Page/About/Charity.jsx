                  is an interdenominational Christian organisation providing
                  care and support to vulnerable children and families. We

                <p><span className="text-slate-600">Paediatric HIV clinic</span> Beautiful Gate works in partnership with the local Provincial clinic as well as other partners to provide a paediatric HIV clinic service to the families and children of the Crossroads area.</p> <br />
                <p><span className="text-slate-600">Children’s Home</span>– Where families are unable to stay together, we provide up to 35 safe places for children needing a safe and loving home before being returned to their family or being fostered. Psycho-social and spiritual support is provided for the children.</p> <br />
                <p><span className="text-slate-600">Family Re-unification</span>– Services ensure that families are located and re-connected to their children. The parents or extended family is then supported to be re-unified with the child. Foster care placement is also done.</p> <br />
                <p><span className="text-slate-600">Activity Centre</span> – The activity centre plays a critical role in child development especially as most of our children require special help including remedial teaching. A team of Child Development Workers help children to grow mentally, spiritually and intellectually, with various activities. Some of the activities include reading & writing, craft and creative work, games and lifeskills, singing and dance.</p> <br />
                <p><span className="text-slate-600">Holiday Clubs</span>  – During the holidays we run fun programmes to ensure children get lots of exercise, enjoy their holiday and learn some life-skills along the way..</p> <br />
